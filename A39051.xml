            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>For firſt, I deſire all the thinking and impartial perſons that Mr. <hi>Keach</hi> doth appeal to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Which way of proving things, or denying thing ſo abundantly proved by Scripture in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, tho it may be beſt pleaſing to them, and alſo ſufficient proof to them, that have found fault with too many Scripture quotations. Yet it is not becoming them that have rejected all that others have ſaid, but what expreſs Scripture can be produced for. And let the impartial and thinking, judg whether it can be ſufficient warrant for, either to beget, or nouriſh a Divine Faith in any Soul that believes this mans Aſſertions, or Negations.</p>
            <p>But a little more particular: A well as this is the moſt part of the proof in general, ſo my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is apprehended in particular, in the firſt place; for giving a book ſuch a Title, as being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his knowledg; and if it is not within the reach of his knowledg, who is ſo capacious, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion can give a Book ſuch a Title, I know not.</hi> And all the reaſon why my Conſcience is thus Judged, is, becauſe none ever ſaw, nor found out thoſe proofs till now. I would deſire all to take notice that it is not, becauſe there is not that proof in Scripture, or becauſe I have not produced Scripture for it; but becauſe none other took notice of it before. So that it muſt be the Symptom of an evil Conſcience, for any one to t ke notice of that from God's word that none ever did take notice of before. How certain a truth ſo ever it be, and how clearly ſo ever the proofs in Scripture are produced for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaith, p. 35. <hi>But I will appeal to all thinking and impartial perſons, whether, or no, this new and bold attempt of this mans doth not give cauſe to all people to doubt of all the former pretended Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofs for Paedo, or Infant Baptiſm, ſince new ways are thought neceſſary to evirce it.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>AS well as the Scripture is ſufficient to diſcover to us, and give us ſufficient ground, and warrant, who were then baptized by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; that we might not be left in that caſe to believe, we know not what. As having no diſtinct diſcoveries, who were the Subjects of that Solemn O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; That were then taken in, and admitted to be of the viſible Church; but ſome imagine one thing, and ſome another; ſome imagine Qualifications of Nature, ſome of Grace, to be the Reaſons of their admiſſion; both which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the nature of the admiſſion in that ſenſe that many contend for.</p>
            <p>For, if Grace do not conſtitute us, or evidence us, to be in already, it can never do it. If the reception of the Lord Jeſus, and quickening by him, do not conſtitute us of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body of Chriſt, whether viſible or inviſible, when we are really partakers of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, then it can never do it. And if Grace, as infuſed and wrought by the Spirit of God, and received by us, cannot do it; that is, make us Members of the Church of God: Then the confeſſion, or making a diſcovery of this Grace, cannot do it ſurely. For it is impoſſible, that the diſcovery of that to men, ſhould do that which the thing it ſelf cannot do before God. And this, when the Right, or Title, or Relation is to be towards God, through his Son, and not with men in a civil reſpect. And if Grace cannot give the right, either in the Nature or the Diſcoveries of it; then ſurely, Nature, eſpecially as to the number of Years, or degrees of Strength, or meaſure of Attainments whatſoever, cannot do it, ſo as to be Qualifications abſolutely neceſſary for admiſſion to that Ordinance, except any can make Nature to be of greater neceſſity, and excellency, than ſupernatural Grace; and ſo render Grace needleſs, as it doth unite us to Chriſt, and make Chriſt alſo needleſs.</p>
            <p>So alſo is the bleſſed word of God, ſufficient to give us warrant for the way and manner of the Adminiſtration of this Solemn Ordinance of Initiation into the Church of God vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: To be by application, or pouring upon, or ſprinkling the perſon baptized with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with the pronunciation of the words or form of Adminiſtration; which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is that which makes and conſtitutes the proper form of this duty, and diſtinguiſheth it from all other Baptiſings whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And if the bleſſed word of God, ſhould not yield matter for our direction and warrant herein, what dreadful confuſion muſt follow as to all?</p>
            <p>For, if we be at a loſs for the right manner of our admiſſion, or the conſtitution of us Members, what heſitation and doubt, muſt there be upon every temptation afterwards, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our State or Intereſt, as to viſible warrant from the word of God? And eſpecially, when the ſubtileſt Adverſaries in their foreſt onſets, and worſt temptations moſt pretend to Scripture Warrant, and Rule. And if there be Direction and Warrant to be had from the Word of God in this caſe, what ſhame is it, that it ſhould be no more ſtudyed and ſearched, that clear Scripture Proof might be produced, for every thing practiſed in ſo ſolemn a Duty?</p>

               </gap>erefore, I have, and ſhall endeavour, in the fear of God, to ſearch into, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to produce clear Scripture Proof in this caſe, relating to this Solemn Ordinance of

            <p>

What <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Diſciples then did as the Meſſengers ſent by Chriſt, as his forerunner, and deligates, was with reſpect to that Covenant and Promiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.55, 70, to 75. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32, 33.</p>
            <p>And the People to whom they were ſent, were they, to whom of right the External Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations did appertain, by the good pleaſure and free donation of God, the Author of the Promiſe; and to one as well as another, and to one as much as another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24, 25, 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.6, 7. And they muſt adminiſter it in ſuch a way, that one might partake of it as well as another, being as expreſly and particularly a ſubject of that Promiſe as another; and if any muſt have been rendered uncapable of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Covenant muſt have been broken as to that perſon.</p>
            <p>And ſhould <hi>John,</hi> and the Diſciples have adminiſtred Baptiſm by Dipping, then all Infants, and all infirm Perſons, muſt have been excluded; which were the greateſt number of the Subjects of the Covenant then living, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39 and are the greateſt number always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all People: and if the Covenant ſhould have been broken, or God's Truth fail to any, what might the reſt expect!</p>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt be ſuch a manner of Baptizing as would conſiſt with the declared objects of Chriſt's Miniſtry, to whom <hi>John</hi> was ſent to prepare for the Lord, and to whom the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were ſent; and the Objects of Chriſt's Miniſtry, were the Circumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. And they were Infants eight days old, to whom then it was to be adminiſtred; and before that age they were of the Circumciſion, being Males of the Circumciſed: And being by Divine Command to partake of it: And in caſe Infants ſhould have been excluded, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Circumciſion, which was Infancy, and in which all were looked upon, muſt have been certainly exploded the Church of Chriſt, and none made mention of, in that capacity. For, if any of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> exceeded eight days old, they were to be cut off as breakers of the Covenant, if they were not circumciſed at eight days old.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such a manner of Baptizing they uſed, and adminiſtred Baptiſm in, as would conſiſt with their participation of the Ordinance, as they were Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their priviledges, as the Children of <hi>Abram:</hi> For that they had, and did enjoy under <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Apoſtles adminiſtrations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23, 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such a manner of Baptizing as would render the Promiſe ſure to all the Seed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. and confirmed the Truth of God to them all, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18, 19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such a manner of Baptizing as would conſiſt with the ordinary natural ſtrength of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Officer to perform, without any miraculous ability.</p>
            <p>It was that which <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did and could perform; for he ſaid, <hi>I have indeed baptized you with Water,</hi> Matth. 3.11. Luke 3.16. Mark 1.8. And what he did, he did by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural ſtrength, for he did no Miracle, <hi>John</hi> 10.40, 41, 42.</p>

            <p>Having premiſed ſome things in general, concerning the way and manner in which the Primitive Baptiſm was performed to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Diſciples of Chriſt. Now let us enquire into thoſe Texts of Scripture, in which we have the way and manner of the Adminiſtration of this Ordinance by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, ſet forth; and that is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water, but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, — he ſhall bapsize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire,</hi> Mark 1.8. <hi>I indeed have baptized you with Water, but he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Luke 3.16. <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water, but one mightier than I cometh,— he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire,</hi> John 1.33. <hi>I knew him not, but he that ſent me to Baptize with Water; the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here our Tranſlators have, and that not without good Reaſons, and weighty Conſiderations, rendred the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> according to the Dialect in the New Teſtament; ſo that we have good ground to believe, that the manner in which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt performed the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm at the firſt Adminiſtration thereof by him, was by applying Water to the perſon, and not by applying the perſon to the Water, by dipping of him into Water, that he then baptized. As the Lord Jeſus was propheſied of by <hi>John,</hi> and alſo does baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, not by putting or dipping the perſon into the Holy Ghoſt, but by pouring out his Spirit upon the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Water is ſo expreſſed, as to be the Inſtrument, wherewith the action of Baptizing was performed; when any action is performed by an Inſtrument, that Inſtrument is expreſſed by this word WITH, or by ſome like term, to ſet it forth by, or expreſs it, to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of them, to whom this action is diſcovered. So <hi>Jacob</hi> ſets forth, how he got the parcel of ground that he gave to his Son <hi>Joſeph;</hi> he gained it with his Sword and with his Bow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48 22. Mary <hi>waſhed the Feet of our Lord with Tears, and wiped them with the Hairs of her Head,</hi> Luke 7.38. <hi>Lord, ſhall we ſmite with the Sword?</hi> Luke 22.49. Now, when perſons do ſmite with the Sword, they do not take the perſon and ſtrike him againſt the Sword, but ſtrike the Sword againſt the perſon. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.67.

            <p>Great has been the noiſe that has been made in the World, and dreadful the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church of God about the manner of external Baptiſm; and abundance of poor confident Souls have affirmed, that the manner of the Primitive Baptiſm was by applying or dipping the perſon baptized into Water, and not by pouring or ſprinkling Water upon the perſon; and many good men, and great Scholars, have too raſhly granted the Primitive Baptiſm, to be performed, by dipping the perſon baptiſed into Water; but by what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ground from the Word of God, I do not know, though I ſhould be glad to know; and it is that which maketh me ſearch into Scripture, that I might know. And if bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with Water, be taken to ſhew to us, the manner of the performance of the Ordinance of Baptiſm, then we may have ſome light, and alſo, warrant, in this caſe; that it was not by dipping, or applying their perſons to Water, but the applying of, and pouring out of Water upon their perſons; by putting the word Dip in the ſtead or place of Baptize; and read the words thus, <hi>I indeed have dipped you into Water, but he ſhall dip you into the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

            <p>In the firſt part of the verſe, <hi>I indeed have baptized you with Water,</hi> Mark 1.8.

<pb facs="tcp:49852:9"/> twice in one verſe; and he intend ſuch contrary things by it, ſhould have been able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he did mean, as to the manner of the performance of it.

But what Soul is there that can have any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ground to believe, That <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> who was one of the greateſt of all the Prophets, and was <hi>filled with the holy Ghost from his mothers Womb,</hi> ſhould have ſuch directly contrary mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by one, and the ſame word, in the ſame mood, at the ſame time about that which one was to be an example, type, figure or repreſentation of the other, his <hi>Baptizing with water,</hi> to ſignify and ſeal <hi>Chriſts Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt?</hi> And if he had ſuch contrary intentions by one and the ſame word, how would this have Anſwered the end of his Miniſtry, in <hi>turning them to the Lord their God?</hi> In caſe they could not underſtand his meaning.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> thoſe Implacable enemies ſhould have underſtood <hi>John</hi> to act and intend by one and the ſame expreſſion contrary things, how would they have railed againſt him and his Miniſtry, and have ſaid, that <hi>he did deceive the people;</hi> and brought this to confirm it; In that he did intend ſuch contrary things by the ſame word, about the ſame ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and never explain his meaning?

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and never make the leaſt explanation of the ſame; how did he <hi>make plain the way of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>help all fleſh to ſee the ſalvation of God?</hi> Was this <hi>to make the way of the Lord direct and straight plain and even</hi> for to make <hi>dipping</hi> to ſignifie <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>dipping the perſon into water,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>pouring the holy Ghoſt upon the perſon,</hi> and to make one word have ſuch contrary ſignifications in expreſſing the <hi>full,</hi> or <hi>both parts of one ordinance,</hi> when <hi>the outward Baptiſm with water,</hi> was to be <hi>a ſign of the Inward Baptiſm with the holy Ghoſt?</hi> Would this <hi>help all fleſh to ſee the Salvation of God.</hi> that was to know Chriſt, when he did come, and appear by the manner of his performance, and to ſee the way of the participation of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual benefits from him, by his outward and external ordinances and way of Adminiſtration of it?

Here theſe words will agree both with the external ſign and internal grace ſignified by the ſign in the way and manner of the communication thereof, foretold by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> had a ſpecial regard to, and came to bring about the fulfilling of. Truth doth uſe to agree, though truth and error can never agree; this will not only make the ſign and the thing ſignified to agree, and the manner of their performance to be one: But this will agree alſo with all the former <hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> of their <hi>cleanſing,</hi> In <hi>their ſprinkling,</hi> and <hi>purifying them with blood;</hi> and alſo <hi>with water of ſeparation, Numbers</hi> 19. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14, 19, 20, 21.

And if it had not been a Sign, why ſhould <hi>John</hi> mention and foretell Chriſt's baptizing them with the Holy Ghoſt?

And if it be not a Sign of Chriſt's baptizing with the Holy Ghoſt, how can it be a Sign of burying with Chriſt? Can it be a ſign of our partaking of any thing of the benefits of Chriſt's death, if it be denyed as a ſign in its nature?

            <p>And if it be a figure, or type what muſt it be a type of? muſt it be of ſalvation in heaven, as happineſs, or of ſalvation from ſin by grace; in the work of the ſpirit of God upon the ſoul?

            <p>And beſides all this, How of neceſſity muſt this ordinance of external Baptiſm be a Sign, being the great ordinance of Initiation, and Diſcipling of members into the viſible Church, which makes it of as great Moment and weight as any divine ſign whatſoever, of the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſpirit of God upon the ſoul.

            <p>And what is there in the external parts of that ordinance of the Bread or Wine, or what action of the Miniſter in preparation, conſecration, or diſtribution; or of the receiver, but is a pertinent ſignification, and a real and lively repreſentation to us of what our ſtate is by ſin, and what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done and ſuffered for poor ſinners.</p>
            <p>If any could prove that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did Baptize with water by dipping them into water, which can never be done by the Bible by any mortal, yet if it could be proved as clearly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, and fully as it hath been proved that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did and does Baptize with the holy Ghoſt by ſprinkling or pouring upon, yet is not the proof that hath been produced of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing by ſprinkling or pouring upon, enough to warrant the practice of the Church of God in ſprinkling?

            <p>But after all this, If any will or do Imagine that <hi>John</hi> did Baptize with water by dipping and did ſo intend, when he ſaid, I indeed baptize you with water, though it hath been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Christs</hi> Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt is by pouring upon or ſprinkling with: Then they muſt make this Divine ſign firſt of all to be different from all ſigns of divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, mentioned in the whole word of God, in that the ſign muſt be performed one way, and the thing ſignified accompliſhed another, the ſign by dipping and the thing ſignified by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon or ſprinkling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then <hi>John</hi> muſt take a contrary way to make known the mind of God to the people, than ever the Prophets of the Lord did, in that he muſt have contrary meanings by one and the ſame word about the ſame Ordinance at the ſame time to the ſame auditory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then few of the people muſt underſtand what <hi>John</hi> did intend, when he told them <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould baptize them with the holy Ghoſt, as to the manner of the performance of it: But in that he muſt be a Barbarian to them; which is Notoriouſly falſe, <hi>John</hi> 10.40, 41, 42.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then it was Impoſſible alſo that they ſhould pray for or depend by faith for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, becauſe they could not tell which way it ſhould be performed, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was Impoſſible that they ſhould believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the true Meſſiah, that <hi>John</hi> had foretold, when he did appear; if <hi>John</hi> ſhould have dipped them into water, and called this Baptizing of them, and propheſie that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould baptize them with the holy Ghoſt, and expreſs it, by the ſame word and in the ſame mood that he did his dipping.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> did appear if he ſhould not take them and dip them into the ſpirit, but pour out his ſpirit upon them, who of them that believed <hi>John</hi> to be a prophet indeed would have believed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Meſſiah indeed? But it would have been the greateſt obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keep them, from believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that could be, contrary to <hi>John</hi> 10.42.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If this were true, then they that Dip muſt be followers of <hi>John,</hi> and all that ſprinkle muſt be followers of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. They that would make this to be the meaning of <hi>John</hi> by this word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> about his own practice of Baptizing, muſt make <hi>Johns</hi> Manner of Baptizing to be humane, except they can prove it by ſome warrant of Scripture. And then alſo their faith muſt be humane that believe it, and their practice humane that follow it, without they can ſhew expreſs warrant for it, as hath been ſhewn for <hi>Chriſts</hi> Baptizing, by pouring upon, or ſprinkling with his ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They that can pervert <hi>Johns</hi> words to the people, may pervert the words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf alſo in <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.5.

            <p>But beſides, a little further to view the words.</p>
            <p>What can be made of theſe words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; I indeed baptize you with water or in water? Is there any ground for any to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that the meaning muſt be, I have dipped you in water? Then they did not go in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nor came forth themſelves, for if they went in, and came out themſelves, then he could neither dip them in, nor take them out,</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49852:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And if He dipped them in, it muſt be the whole perſon; for he ſpeaks to them as Individuals, and to every individual of them, and makes no limitation of any particular part of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he had dipped. And it muſt be in their wearing apparel; for we read of no deveſting of them. And when any can prove by Scripture that any one Miniſter of ordinary ſtrength can dip all ſorts of perſons of whatſoever age, ſex, condition, ſtature or dimenſion they be, in a whole region, or in City, and Countrey, then I hope I ſhall have faith to believe ſuch Doctrine. But till I have the word of God for it, I muſt and do eſteem it Impoſſible, though if it could be done there muſt be a twofold Baptiſm; One Immediate, and the other Mediate by the clothes.</p>
            <p>And if it be taken, I have baptized you in water, then the meaning muſt be, that he ſpake the words while they were in the water; and whether they went in, or he put them in, that reſpects nothing of the act, but muſt be in order to the act of his Baptizing of them.</p>
            <p>And this Argueth nothing to prove by way of diſtinction whether the water were caſt or ſprinkled upon them in the water, or whether they were dipped further in. But if it gives ground for either, It is for ſprinkling or pouring water upon them: For in caſe a perſon be took and caſt into the water, or dipped in, and there held while the words are ſpoken, which gives the form to the Ordinance, to diſtinguiſh it from all other, the perſon might be ſtifled</p>
            <p>If <hi>John</hi> ſpake no more words in his Adminiſtration than what is commanded by Chriſt to be ſaid now, yet ſome weak conſtitutions muſt, and would be ſtifled, if they were held under water ſo long. But if Water be poured or ſprinkled upon them, there can be no danger of any harm as to the pouring upon.</p>
            <p>And if any take the act to be done by <hi>John</hi> while they were in the water then we have no ground from hence of the alteration of the poſition of the perſon baptized, in the reception of the Baptiſm in water.</p>
            <p>And if the perſon muſt be in water to be baptized, then this condemns the baptiſm in the Red ſea, for they were upon dry land, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2.</p>
            <p>And if the words be ſtrictly taken, I have baptized you in water; Then the ſtreſs of the ſenſe muſt lie, not as to the manner, whether it be done by dipping or ſprinkling, nor can the form of words yield any proof for it; but only that the perſon Baptized be in water when the act it ſelf be performed by the Baptizer, nor whether he be under water or not, ſo he be baptized in water, and then <hi>Pauls</hi> was not this way who was baptized in a houſe, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.18. and how any will prove the baptizing of the three thouſand in ſome part of an Artificial day was while they were in the water, is unknown <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.41, 42. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>But it muſt be in ſuch a manner as the baptized muſt be wholly paſſive in the act, and no coagent, or coadjuvant, for they were Baptized in the paſſive voice, and then one part of the perſon muſt not be in the water before, for then it cannot be dipt in, nor muſt one part ſtand upon terra firma, for then that perſon cannot be wholly paſſive in the reception of Baptiſm in the whole perſon, unleſs any do account the lower part of the perſon no part of the perſon, or a part not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then what <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt could not be true, But all that <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt was true: Therefore he did not intend <hi>dipping into the holy Ghost,</hi> by Chriſts <hi>Baptizing them with it,</hi> but <hi>pouring upon, ſhedding upon,</hi> and <hi>ſprinkling with,</hi> by Chriſts <hi>baptizing them with the holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. <hi>Titus.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44, 45, 46. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.15, 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that it was ground of faith in the people to believe in Chriſt, <hi>John.</hi> 10.42 What <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt was true, even all things of it, and many believed on him there; The <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction copulative</hi> knitting together <hi>Johns</hi> words and the truth of it, and their believing ſheweth that the things that <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt being true, they believed on him upon that Teſtimony <hi>John</hi> had given: What was ground of faith in the people, and that to many and not a few. And in the very place too, that <hi>John</hi> ſpake theſe things at firſt and baptized, were certain truths. But <hi>Johns</hi> words or Teſtimony of Chriſt was ground of faith to many of the people in the very place where <hi>John</hi> at firſt Baptized and ſpake them. Therefore <hi>Johns</hi> words of Chriſt were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true. And therefore <hi>John</hi> did not mean nor intend by Chriſts Baptizing, <hi>dipping into,</hi> but <hi>pouring</hi> upon or <hi>ſprinkling with the holy Ghost,</hi> by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. When he did come</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be further Proved from the holy ſpirit, that <hi>John</hi> was filled with and acted by, in the work of his Miniſtry. <hi>He was filled with the holy Ghoſt from his mothers womb, and came in the ſpirit of Elias, Luke</hi> 1.16, 17. Now if it was by the ſame ſpirit of truth and holineſs that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſpake by, and was acted by, as others of the holy Prophets of the Lord were acted by, then what <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt was true, and was in every thing intended by him, as it ſhould be, and was performed by Chriſt, when he came, and did perform them: Therefore <hi>John</hi> did intend <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>pouring upon</hi> by Chriſts <hi>Baptizing them with the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be further proved from <hi>Johns</hi> office, <hi>He was a Prophet:</hi> And what <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt he ſpake as a prophet, foretelling of it, both as to the matter, and the manner of the performance. And that he was a <hi>prophet,</hi> Chriſt himſelf doth witneſs, and <hi>the greateſt of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Matth.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. And <hi>the word of God came to him in an immediate manner,</hi> as to others of the <hi>Prophets, Luke</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. And therefore he did intend, by Chriſts <hi>baptizing with the holy Ghost, his pouring out the holy Ghost upon them,</hi> and <hi>ſhedding, it upon them</hi> and his ſprinkling them with it, which titles the holy Ghoſt does afterwards give to the thing, that <hi>John</hi> expreſſed and intended by baptizing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. with the holy Ghoſt. And for any to gain ſay it, is to deny <hi>Johns</hi> being a prophet of the Lord. The Prophet did foreſee what they foretold. <hi>Iſaia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, <hi>Baptize,</hi> when he ſaid to the people, <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water.</hi> And this may be proved, <hi>First,</hi> from God, the Author of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm. <hi>His Baptiſm was from Heaven,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25, 26, 27, 32. and he muſt not intend dipping by his baptizing, nor perform it by dipping. <hi>First,</hi> from God, <hi>his being the God of Order, and not of Confuſion;</hi> in the work that he doth himſelf, or that he ſendeth his Servants to do in his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. <hi>God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace.</hi> And this in all Churches of the Saints, and the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom <hi>John</hi> was now ſent, was the only Church of God upon the Earth, and therefore God was not the Author of Confuſion in this Church.

And ſo to take Dipping in a Scripture Senſe, and then it will be found to be a thing impoſſible, or an act impoſſible for any one Individual to perform, to all ſorts, ſexes, ages, and degrees of perſons whatſoever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſurely, <hi>John</hi> did not baptize by dipping, nor intend dipping by his ſaying, <hi>he had bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized them with Water;</hi> for it was impoſſible for him to do it by his ordinary, natural, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtrength; and he had no other, for <hi>he did no Miracle,</hi> John 10.41, 42.</p>
               <p>But ſome may object, and ſay, <hi>That it is not expreſly ſaid, that he poured upon, or ſprinkled with Water.</hi> I anſwer, no more is it expreſly ſaid, <hi>that he dipped;</hi> but it is ſaid, <hi>he baptized with Water;</hi> and he told them, <hi>That our Lord Jeſus, when he did appear, ſhould baptize them with the holy Ghost.</hi> And this kind of baptizing is expreſly called, <hi>pouring upon, ſhedding upon, falling upon, ſitting upon, blowing upon, and ſprinkling with in Scripture,</hi> Acts 2.3, 4, 5, 16, 17, 33.

And if they Do own either gifts or graces given to them and received this way as right, It muſt be from a change of their Judgment, about external Baptiſm, or by way of Compulſion that they can have it, or partake of it no other way.

And if Chriſts way be the beſt way, why ſhould <hi>Johns</hi> ſuppoſed way that cannot be proved by Scripture, be ſo contended for by any Soul, and ſuch Rents, Diviſions and Seperations made in the viſible Body of Chriſt about it? and why ſhould any <hi>Soul living</hi> have the face to call that Chriſts way which they do, but ſuppoſe was <hi>Johns,</hi> and cannot by Scripture prove it to be <hi>Johns</hi> way or Chriſts way either?

And they at leaſt ſome of them receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by faith which muſt neceſſarily prove the object of faith to be there, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.20. which certainly diſcovers to the full Our Lord Jeſus his acceptation of this word. 5. We may ſee and perceive how Chriſt underſtood and accepted this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as to external Baptiſm, In that he was a miniſter of the circumciſion to confirm the truth of God made to the Fathers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. The circumciſion comprehended the Infant eight days old as well as any adult perſon, and in the ſame capacity he was looked upon as the Adult, And the Adult could not have been in the capacity with the Infant to be of the Circumciſion, if he were an Iſraelite, and had not been circumciſed in Infancy: And upon the ſame account, and cauſe that he was the Miniſter to one, he was the miniſter to the other, and that is for the truth of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the promiſe made to the fathers: Now if this text be any way objected againſt, as to the matter in hand, it muſt be becauſe, that Baptiſm did not come within the external admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Chriſt as Miniſter, and if it did not, I wonder where any will place it. Or to what they will attribute it! And what they will make of Chriſts Miniſtry, Gal. 3.5. I would pray all ſuch to view that text. If any will object and ſay that by circumciſion, we be to underſtand the Circumciſion of heart. I Anſwer who ſhould circumciſe them in heart, for to be ſubjects of Chriſts Miniſtry. And if none but the circumciſed in heart, then this muſt exclude the Elect of God uncalled and who ſhall bring them in. 3. If it were that it did intend the circumciſed in heart only, yet that will not exclude children; For Chriſt has done that work for ſome of them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49852:24"/> too; As <hi>Iſaac, Sampſon, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. 4. This muſt make that we muſt bring grace to the Lord Jeſus, and not come to him for it, <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 36.27. 5. To limit it to the circumciſed in heart only, muſt make the ſubjects Miniſtry to be Inviſible, and the Miniſtry to be the Internal work of Chriſt, in perfecting what he hath begun in any Soul, or elſe to make that Internal grace can and does live only with external means for Nouriſhment. Let men and Devils make what cavils they will againſt this text. It is clear from this text That the ſubjects of Chriſts miniſtry were Infants as well as the Adult; And if ſo, Then all the Acts of it muſt be ſuch, and eſpecially Baptiſm ſuch as they were capable of partaking of, and Sharing in. Or elſe Chriſts miniſtry muſt be undertaken in vain, his miniſtry reſpected all that the promiſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or did appertain to: And if it did not appertain to children ſee <hi>Mala</hi> 4 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. And if that did appertain to the youngeſt Infants, then they were as certainly the ſubjects of Chriſts Miniſtry as the adult; And then Baptiſm, which was one ſpecial part of his external Miniſtry muſt and was performed by ſprinkling, and not by Dipping, the ſubjects of his Miniſtry being not capable of it. All the Fathers were Baptized in the Red Sea, which muſt comprehend the ſmalleſt Infant as well as the perſon adult, and that was done by Chriſt as Miniſter to the Circumciſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. If any had no right to Baptiſm, they had no right to any thing elſe of Chriſts Miniſtry, For that is the door of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to All other parts of it, or priviledges to be enjoyed. as viſible members: And of ſuch this text ſpeaks, Chriſt being ſent to them as ſuch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us enquire how <hi>Peter</hi> the Great Apoſtle of the Circumciſion did accept this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and what he did intend by it in his uſe of it, who was the firſt great and Eminently ſucceſsful Preacher among them after Chriſts Reſurrection, and the firſt uſer of this word after that time. That he did underſtand falling upon, pouring upon, ſhedding upon and ſprinkling with as to the Internal Baptiſm is clear from his own Expreſs words; compare <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44, 45, 47. with <hi>Acts</hi> 11.15, 16, 17. and <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 17, 33. and 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.2.

By his preſſing of it as the duty of all by way of command to whom the promiſe did belong, and that upon the account and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the promiſe belonging or appertaining to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. 3. Alſo his expreſſions by way of queſtion to all, when he was in the aſſembly where many were met together in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his family, or houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.46, 47. can any forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized who have received the holy Ghoſt as well as us? If any will deny childrens or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being there, they muſt deny the whole Scripture, If <hi>Acts</hi> 15.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. betruly &amp; rightly conſider'd. And if any object &amp; ſay, There were no children there becauſe they that are there ſpoken of, were heard to ſpeak with tongues: I anſwer, that will rather confirm that they were there; For their ſpeaking could not be a greater miracle than their ſpeaking with tongues. And the Babes and ſucklings in the Temple had as eminent a priviledge to ſet forth the praiſes of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.14, 15.

The people being ſo well acquainted with the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they could not gainſay the letter of the law, and eſpecially the ceremonial part thereof. That being the moſt of the religion then in faſhion. If any ſay that the Apoſtle does not declare his Judgment here, but reports their uſe of the word that is the <hi>Jews</hi> and Phariſees; I anſwer, The greater ground this gives to believe that the Primitive Baptiſm was not by <hi>Dipping,</hi> but by ſprinkling; For if this was the acceptation of the word among the Phariſees and <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſet forth, their ceremonial purifyings which were by expreſs divine command to be performed by ſprinkling, then that was the acceptation of it, by the Apoſtles too, In that they do not in the leaſt gainſay it. Nor never give it any other ſignification. And ſhould the <hi>Jews</hi> have broken the command of God, and done it by <hi>Dipping,</hi> how would our Lord Jeſus have ſhewed his abhorrence of their wickedneſs, therein? Or would <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and Chriſt; and his Apoſtles have followed them, in their way of violating the commands of God that were then in full force? They that have ſuch a belief have little ground for what they do in Imitation of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.24, 26. How often did Chriſt call them the blind Phariſees and ſerpents, and a generation of vipers? <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.31, 32, 33. which are ſad creatures to follow, eſpecially when we know them. Or elſe can it be Imagined that the Phariſees and all the <hi>Jews</hi> would in the performance of their own inventions follow Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, if <hi>John</hi> had Dipped, or if Chriſt had Dipped and his Diſciples? Did they not ſay <hi>John</hi> had a Devil? and that Chriſt was a friend of Publicans and ſinners? and did they not make a law that whoſoever did confeſs Chriſt ſhould be put out of the Synagogue? and then much more from the Temple? <hi>John.</hi> 9. and did they not quarrel againſt, and were they not enraged that ſo many did come to his Baptiſm? <hi>John</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. <hi>John.</hi> 4.1, 2. and were worſe in their carriage to <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and Chriſt than the Publicans and harlots, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.32. So that the Phariſees could not uſe this word to ſignifie Dipping from God, nor Chriſt nor from <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, and then they muſt have it from themſelves, and if ſo, Then Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> would not follow them in their wickedneſs, and if any ſhould ſay they might have it from the Heathens, that will not mend the matter, but make it worſe. But it is clear from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous texts where we have both Chriſt and <hi>John</hi> and them uſing the word about one and the ſame thing, that their performance of it was one and the ſame way, and that they all had one and the ſame acceptation of the word, <hi>John</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.38. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4, 8. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there could be no other ſignification of this word upon any hand, than ſprinkling in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And this about the external Baptiſm, as well as the Internal; Even by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and by others. And the things they baptized as well as their perſons will confirm it, which was upon the outſide of their Pots and cups and brazen veſſels, and of Beds or Tables, or any other Utenſil, Tent, or Houſe, which were by Gods command to be cleanſed or purified, when a perſon died in the tent or houſe, and the things or Utenſils were made unclean thereby, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.50, 51, 52. <hi>Numbers</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, 19.

So that it is clear that <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and intend by this word <gap reason="foreign">

Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe words are ſpoken as <hi>Peters</hi> were in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. Repent ye therefore, and be baptized every one of you, looking upon them in their natural guilt and filth: Or whether as thoſe that were externally baptized already, but needed the Inward benefit of it, like <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 51.7. It is all one for that, If the firſt word be applied to the Inward Baptiſm by Chriſt with his ſpirit, ſo it is alſo of the outward and external, and the latter word is uſed to expreſs the legal purifications, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.24. Whereby we have the Teſtimony of this bleſſed ſervant of God, as to his acceptation and his ſignification of the word. And we have another text to ſhew his acceptation of the word to be the ſame with <hi>Peters, Acts</hi> 15.9, 13. and <hi>Peters</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>Johns</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> the 8.14, 15, 16. Now when the Apoſtles which were at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> heard that the Gentiles had received the word of God, They ſent to them <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> Who when they were come, prayed for them that they might receive the holy Ghoſt: For as yet he was fallen upon none of them, only they were Baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus; Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghoſt. Obſerve, It was fallen upon none of them as yet. Not they put into that, but it fell upon them, and they received it. And <hi>Paul's</hi> and <hi>James</hi> his acceptation of it was the ſame with all the reſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.15, 16. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.6, 7, 8, 9. When <hi>Peter</hi> had declared how God at firſt did take out of the Gentiles a people for his name, and put no difference between the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and them, purifying their hearts by faith. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> brings a text relating to the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>David. Acts</hi> 15.13, 14, 15.16. And confirms what <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid, which is a ſufficient proof that he underſtood it, in the ſame ſenſe that <hi>Peter</hi> did. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Let us enquire how <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles did underſtand this word, and what he did intend by this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And here with reſpect to <hi>Paul,</hi> as all the ſervants of Chriſt, the holy Apoſtles, and as Chriſt their Lord and maſter did underſtand, accept and uſe this word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to ſignifie pouring upon, ſhedding upon and ſprinkling with; So did this holy, and faithful ſervant of Chriſt take it, and uſe it to ſignifie the ſame. As may appear in his Epiſtle both to the Circumciſion the Hebrews, and in his diſcourſes with them, as to the ſpiritual Baptiſm by Chriſt with his ſpirit. For his apprehenſion of the Inward Baptiſm with the holy Ghoſt ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. He came in his Journeying and Travels to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and finding certain diſciples he ſaid unto them, Have ye received the holy Ghoſt ſince ye believed? And they ſaid unto him, we have not ſo much as heard whether there be any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Where by the way, we may ſee how much truth there is in that perſwaſion, That <hi>John</hi> baptized none but true penitents, and this repentance to be made forth by a confeſſion of their ſins. Theſe could do this with the witneſs, that had not heard ſo much, as whether there were any holy Ghoſt. And he ſaid unto them, Unto what then were ye Baptized? And they ſaid, Unto <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm. Then ſaid <hi>Paul, John</hi> verily baptized with the baptiſm of Repentance, ſaying unto the People, that they ſhould believe in him that was to come after, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus. When they heard this they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that there is no record of any confeſſion required, or made, of the truth of the grace of faith as wrought in their hearts, to give them a right to Baptiſm verſe 6th. When <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands on them, (he did not put them into his hands but laid his hands on them. As the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 16, 17.) The holy Ghoſt came on them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The holy Ghoſt came upon THEM not they took and dipt into that. The Learned tell us that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and is uſed again in abundance of places in the <hi>New Testament.</hi> As <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.27. <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49852:28"/> 2.21. &amp;c. So in <hi>Titus</hi> the 3.5, 6. Which he ſhed on us abundantly. Through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. It is not put them into that, but poured out, or ſhed forth that upon them. The word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> uſed again in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 33. So alſo in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10.22. He witneſſeth the ſame thing, which is Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt. Let us Draw near, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2. Have ye received the holy Ghoſt? ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. Where obſerve that all that we receive does come to us, not we be put or dipt into that. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. All that we have of the abundance of Grace is ſaid to be received, and all the difference that is made between us and others, or between what we were in our ſelves, is ſaid to be received in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. And whatſoever is given to us is ſaid to fall upon us, or come to us, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44, 47. So that with all clearneſs <hi>Paul</hi> does bear witneſs that he underſtood by Chriſts Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt, Pouring upon, ſhedding upon, ſprinkling with, the holy Ghoſt, and not our being Dipped into that. And as to his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and uſe of the word as to the external baptiſm with water, we may have a clear diſcovery from Scripture alſo. And one text we have his acceptation of it as to that diſcovered in, is in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. Where he ſpeaks only of the Outward ſign, and nothing of the internal Baptiſm by the holy Ghoſt, and were all baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the cloud, and in the ſea. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Which ſhould be rendered, and were all Baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> by, or with the Cloud in the Sea. That is, in the place where the Sea did uſe to run, though now the Motion of it was Stopped by the mighty power of God. And a way made for them to Paſs over as upon dry land, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29. There can be but two ways of Baptizing with water, the one is by applying, or putting the perſon into water, and the other by applying the water to the Perſon by pouring of it out upon him, or ſprinkling him with it. Now in the text their being baptized is aſſerted and affirmed by the holy Ghoſt. And the Baptizor Named is <hi>Moſes,</hi> by whoſe conduct they were bid go on, <hi>Exod</hi> 14.15. And the way whereby it was done is intimated to us by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof the Cloud, and the place where it was done, and that is in the Red Sea. Which they paſſed through as upon dry land <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29. Now Dipped, or ſprinkled they muſt be. But Dipped in water they could not be, nor were not, becauſe they paſſed as upon dry land, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29. And the Red Sea ſtood up like a wall: Therefore ſprinkled they muſt be and were, Becauſe not Dipped. They paſſed, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> rendered by <hi>tranſeo, trajicio,</hi> uſed again <hi>Acts</hi> 16.9. Come over and help us, which was with a ſpeedy motion: So <hi>Luke</hi> 16.26. Which ſhewed they ſtood not ſtill in their Motion to be Dipped perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Diametrically. And this Motion was not of ſome, but of all, by their own perſonal ſtrength, or by others. So that as ſome were baptized So were all baptized. And if any ſhould ſay that they might be all wet, as much as if they had been dipt. But wetting is not dipping. That is the caſe; I Anſwer that cannot be matter of faith, becauſe not recorded in Gods word. Neither is it the way of God to prefer ſacrifice before mercy; For ſhould they have been much wet, how ever ſome might have endured it, yet what muſt the women, and children and little ones have done in the wilderneſs into which they were then going, where they had neither habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation nor fire ready to dry or warm them, or change to ſhift themſelves with, for their clothes waxed not old, nor their foot ſwelled, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. But if they were not Dipped, how can it be proved that they were ſprinkled? I Anſwer If they were Baptized, It muſt be by Dipping or ſprinkling, But they were baptized, but not by Dipping, therefore by ſprinkling. 2. If the baptized were upon dry ground it was by ſprinkling. 3. If the baptized were in motion in the Interim of the time of reception, then it was by ſprinkling. 4. If the great, and whole Hoſt were baptized in one night, it was by ſprinkling. 5. If there was but one Baptizor then it was done by ſprinkling: But there was but one Baptizor, even one <hi>Moſes.</hi> 6. If what is done from the Cloud is by drops, then it was done by ſprinkling. 7. Where there are Infants baptized as well as adult, it was and muſt be done by ſprinkling, but ſo it was here.

It is ſtrange if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſhould perform his Immediate works in an unlawful manner, or in an Iregular manner;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49852:28"/> and does the holy Ghoſt uſe to bring Impertinent arguments? It is brought as an argument to the Corinthians that they would take heed of ſinning againſt God, under ſuch priviledges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out real godlineſs. And if all muſt be rejected for argument that is brought from extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what uſe ſhall, or can be made of the whole Bible? Eſpecially the generality of the <hi>New Teſtament?</hi> Muſt there be a proof for any thing? All was done by extraordinary perſons upon extraordinary occaſions, and by extraordinary cauſes in the days of the Lord Jeſus, and his immediate ſervants. Muſt not the whole 11th Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> be razed for proof? Was not <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt baptizing ſuch a multitude in ſuch a place or places, and their confeſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary? is the like to be produced? Was not the miſſion of <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and his preaching to him and the ſucceſs of his preaching, and his baptizing and confeſſion, and all; Can any match it? And what of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is not? Why ſhould any Mortals have the face to caſt this as an obſtruction, when the thing in debate and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is what the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> does ſignifie and how <hi>Paul</hi> doth underſtand it, and take it to ſignifie with reſpect to external baptiſm and this is a plain Scripture proof that he did take it to ſignifie ſprinkling and pouring upon, and this with reſpect to the whole Church of God, at that time upon Earth. And that it does not ſignifie, nor does he intend by it Dipping into water. In the meaning of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians, it was then in no other manner performed than what the ſmalleſt Infant might pertake of it, in the Red Sea; If it was not, how could all the fathers be baptized? And if his baptizing of the Corinthians had not been by the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Or if they had not been baptized in the ſame manner, as to ſprinkling, as it was by God in the Red Sea: How might the Corinthians have ſaid that they had not the right Baptiſm, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> did Baptize with the Baptiſm that was more like an external ſign than <hi>Paul?</hi> And that they had more of the Goſpel Preached to them in the Red Sea from the cloud as to diſcover the Baptiſm of Chriſt with the holy Ghoſt than ever they had, and ſo have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Baptiſm; If the Corinthians did not ſay this, many in our days would have ſaid it, and abundance more, and rejected Miniſtry and Baptiſm and all participation of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances with them, and called them lyers and antichriſtian; If <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have baptized by Dipping or <hi>plunging,</hi> and yet expreſs the very ſame Baptiſm when performed by the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> by the ſame word, and it did clearly ſignifie to ſprinkle, and it might eaſily be proved that it was done by ſprinkling, What an advantage would the falſe teachers have taken to have rendred <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry and labours null and void and ineffectual among the Corinthians? And they would have proved him an Impoſtor and an intruder upon them out of his own mouth, and from his own words, and this by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they all acknowledged that God ſpake by, and how muſt this have deſtroyed Baptiſm from being of the Nature of a ſign, type and figure, He in all his Epiſtles aſſenting the Grace of God to be received by them, and they not received by that, or put into it. And he always aſſerting it to be given them by ſprinkling <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Or ſhedding upon, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5, 6. By this we may ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> was baptized himſelf in the houſe or chamber, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.18. He aſſerting ſprinkling with water to be baptizing. And how he baptized them in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.3, 4, 5, 6, And how he baptized the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31, 32, 33. And how he baptized <hi>Lydia</hi> and her houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. If any one can ſhew ſo much ground for <hi>Pauls</hi> underſtanding and taking the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Dipping into water, for my part I ſhall thank them, and never revile them for what they bring for proof with that evidence of Scripture from <hi>Pauls</hi> writings in the Scripture as this is. For if <hi>Pauls</hi> Intentions by this word mentioning the means whereby it was done, and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their motion the while it was done, and place, they paſſed on the dry ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29.

The adminiſtration being not the ſame as to manner, which to ſome is the all, and if they I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine it not to be the right way, though they have no Scripture but mens opinions, they will renounce their Baptiſm. And it muſt have had a contrary effect to have ſtirred up in them a diſlike of <hi>Paul</hi> and their Baptiſm, from his Expreſſions and adminiſtrations. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> it would have raiſed queſtions in their minds whether <hi>Pauls</hi> calling and his adminiſtrations had been from heaven, in that he adminiſtred baptiſm another way than what God did it by

Then the word baptize muſt ſignifie two things with reſpect to external baptiſm that is, Dipping, and ſprinkling, but one thing as to internal baptiſm, and that is pouring upon or ſprinkling with. And this when dipping was and is Impoſſible. 6. This would have been urged by the falſe Apoſtles againſt <hi>Paul</hi> if he ſhould have done it contrary to <hi>Moſes,</hi> 7. Then they muſt have concluded that their baptiſm external was not a ſign of the Internal baptiſm. But ſomething by it ſelf. And without it can be diſcovered what it is, it muſt have been accounted null and void. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Let us enquire how all the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and Church of the Circumciſion did underſtand this word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> whoſe Paſtors and Teachers did ſo often expreſs their minds in this word to them? And this we may find by their being preſent where this word was uſed, and other ſynonymous terms to expreſs it uſed alſo, and no manner of explication given to this word, nor to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſetting of it forth, by them that expreſſed their minds to them by it; and no expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation required, nor objection made of their not underſtanding or knowing what was meant, and intended by it: as the Apoſtles did, and was uſual when they did not underſtand Chriſts Parables. They asked their Lord and maſter, the meaning of the Parable, this may be clearly obſerved from <hi>Acts</hi> 11.1, 2. when <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they that were of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion contended with him; and <hi>Peter</hi> maketh a repetition in order of the matter. And in verſe the 15th he ſaith as he began to ſpeak, the holy Ghoſt fell on them, as on us at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, and this he calls baptizing in verſe the 16th, and all underſtood what he meant by the word in that they glorifyed God, ſaying, Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life, verſe 18. So alſo in the Great aſſembly <hi>Acts</hi> 15.4. which conſiſted of the Church, Apoſtles, and Elders.

And put no difference between the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and them, purifying their hearts by faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. And in all this the ſame thing is intended that <hi>John</hi> foretold, and that Chriſt called the Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt. And <hi>Peter</hi> had alſo ſo called it before, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.16. And all kept ſilence as fully underſtanding what was

The ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt was that which ſanctified them. And the way whereby it was done was by ſprinkling, as the matter was Chriſts blood. So the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience. And the General Epiſtle of <hi>James James</hi> 4.8.

Where their ſprinkling in the Red Sea by the Cloud, or pouring upon is ſet forth by this word. No man living I ſuppoſe that ſtands in awe of wrangling againſt Scripture can give any other Diſcovery than by ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Scripture, of the Baptiſm there ſpoken of, and this was of the manner of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the viſible ſign, and this expreſly, and of all the whole hoſt, and not of ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the place where, and the kind of it dry ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29. and the relation they ſtood unto them in, as Fathers by profeſſion, though not by natural generation, and then all that were exempted baptiſm of that great hoſt muſt not own God, or have God for their God. and that was not Infants a ſpan long in Iſrael, for they had God for their God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. and the Baptiſm of the Corinthians muſt be by ſprinkling to, or elſe they could not ſtand in that relation to them as children to fathers by profeſſion; Unleſs the Corinthians were of another mind, than many are of now, who account Dipping the only way, and enveigh againſt ſprinkling, and account Baptiſm that way, as no baptiſm, for they muſt renounce that, and be dipped, though ſcarce any part can be truly according to Scripture acceptation of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſaid to be Dipped, but only put in ſome part under water. I am perſwaded that in our days many would have renounced them to be their Fathers by profeſſion in religion that had been baptized by ſprinkling. Though how ever men eſteem it, thus the holy Ghoſt has ſtiled them, to the believing profeſſing Corinthians. And this not ſuch as were truly Godly, neither that God had ſucceeded their outward baptiſm with the Inward, but ſuch, as with many of whom God was not well pleaſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. The like relation is aſſerted by <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 15.10. and owned by all in that aſſembly. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. It is called a putting on of Chriſt, and Surely they underſtood it. Though putting on of a garment, or any thing elſe, by any perſon upon another is not by putting the perſon into the garment or any thing, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that upon the perſon. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. It is called a baptizing by the ſpirit into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Now the ſpirit do not take the perſon into the Church the body of Chriſt, but confers the priviledg of Adoption upon him, <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. and what is rendered unto <gap reason="foreign">

The young man that obſerved and kept all from his youth does ſhew it That they did purifie, and were to purifie is as clear, becauſe it was not put an end to till the death of Chriſt, and that they expreſſed their purifying by this word is as clear as any thing elſe from this text, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.38.

Had they not had a law they could never have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to righteouſneſs in it: Touching the righteouſneſs that is in the law blameleſs.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49852:31"/> have obſerved them accordingly. And beſides, was it likely, That the Phariſees who were for the leſſer matters of the law and for an eaſie light religion themſelves, whatever burthens they did lay upon others, would turn ſprinkling upon ſome part of the body to the Dipping of the whole perſon in water? and this ſo frequent as they did baptize, which was as often as they did eat, and this of all the <hi>Jews</hi> too <hi>Mark</hi> 7.1, 2, and Immediately before Dinner, and beſides the perſon that was unclean was not to touch the water him ſelf, for whatſoever he did touch he did defile, and whatſoever he did touch, and if any one elſe did touch him he was defiled, <hi>Numbers</hi> 19.22. <hi>John</hi> 8.28. And how then could he that was looked upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean be dipt into it? And who could graſp him, and not touch the water, and yet dip him? or how could he and the unclean perſon go together into the water as ſome Imagin <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> did? <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38. And where could they have a clean perſon? for ſuch a one they muſt have to cleanſe, them if it were with water, and the Prieſt, if it were with blood; <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.18, 19. <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.14. If all were to be dipt before they did eat they muſt not all eat at one hour, and with knowledg of one anothers hour, who ſhould be capable to dip the reſt elſe? and how few could they have for ſtrength to perform this act of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing to all ſorts of perſons of whatſoever age or ſex? and either ſuch as did do it muſt never be unclean or capable of Defilement, or muſt never eat themſelves, or not be of the Phariſees, or <hi>Jews</hi> Religion, and where ſhould they have pits or Rivers enough to go into to dip after this manner? and if it was in their preſent wearing apparel, they muſt all have abundance of change. And if without apparel that they did Baptize, they muſt be ſo far from Religion, as not to have humanity; Baptize they did, but if it was by dipping ſo often as they did Baptize, it muſt be altogether Impoſſible and Intolerable, as to baptizers and Baptized; Therefore believe it who can ſuppoſing they kept to the letter of the Law, it muſt be done by ſprinkling. And <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did it the ſame way why, elſe did the Phariſees ſo ſtile his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, <hi>John</hi> 1.24, 25. and this as meſſengers to examine and to carry tydings to the Sanedrim at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and as ſent out to that end by them. Would they give <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm a wrong Denomination or title in love to it, and if in hatred never raiſe one quarrel in one word againſt the doing of it? They made more conſcience then, than thouſands in our days do, if they did do ſo. However this is certain that they muſt ſtep beyond the Devil in what he did in his diſpute with Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. And beyond what the Sadduces did in denying the Reſurrection, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.23, to 32. If they make any gain-ſaying of the expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that declares that their purifying was by ſprinkling, and this they called baptizing, and this with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the external baptizing with water, <hi>John</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.38. and the ſame we have alſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 7.2, 3, 4, 8. Where the utenſils mentioned ſome at leaſt, were not poſſible to be dipped by any one ſingle perſon. The matter is clear, that their baptizings were their religious waſhings, how elſe could they be ſaid to draw near to God with the mouth, and with the outward man in it? and by the command of God this was to be performed by ſprinkling. And who can prove that they had turned it to Dipping? Does not Chriſts call it purifying, and making clean of the outſide of the cup and platter? and does not this prove that it was not changed as to manner, tho as to matter it was their own inventions. If any can give from Scripture ſuch or more evidence that they did dip in their religious purifications, then there will be matter for faith to believe; But till then, all that men ſay muſt go for Dogma, an opinion. But a little further, that we may find out the acceptation of this one word among theſe worthy Phariſees and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Element was old <hi>Mumſimus,</hi> let us view the Synonymous terms whereby this one word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is ſet forth, and the matter intended by it expreſſed in Scripture, in their Dialougues with Chriſt. And one word that is frequently uſed to expreſs the ſame thing that at other times they expreſſed by baptizing is <gap reason="foreign">

Which is not by dipping the face into the water, if it be taken in a civil ſenſe. It is uſed to expreſs the ſame thing with Baptize, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.2, 20. and <hi>Mark</hi> 7.1, 2, 3, 4. and the ſame thing or action is ſet forth by <gap reason="foreign">
